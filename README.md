# Introduction

This repository contains data employed for studies on phylogenetics and elevational distributions of birds in the genus *Scytalopus*. 

The molecular datasets were used for analyses of phylogeny and diversification in:

    Systematics, biogeography and diversification of Scytalopus tapaculos (Rhinocryptidae), 
    an enigmatic radiation of Neotropical montane birds.

Data on elevational distributions were analyzed in:

    flightless birds – most diversity in tropical mountains accumulates via secondary contact 
    following allopatric speciation. In press in: Rull, V. & Carnaval, A. (eds.),

# Data

**DNA Sequence Data**

We constructed phylogenies of most *Scytalopus* and their near relatives using sequences of a total of 1,246,332 base pairs of nuclear DNA sequences corresponding to regions flanking 1,833 ultra conserved elements (UCEs; 1,201,528 bp) and 80 exons (44,804 bp). The file `aligment_subset_fasta-zip` contains alignments for each of these regions which we used to construct phylogenies in concatenated and species-tree analyses. Raw data will be made available once a large-scale project on the phylogeny of suboscine birds led by M. Harvey et al. is completed.

We also conducted phylogenetic analyses based on sequences of the mitochondrial ND2 gene for close to 300 specimens. The file `Scytalopus309_ND2-revised-May2019.phy` contains the ND2 alignment we employed. Individual ND2 sequences were also submitted to GenBank.


**Elevational Distributions**

The file `Scytalopus_ElevationData_47taxa.csv` contains minimum and maximum elevation for the 47-taxa dataset described in the manuscript. The file `Scytalopus_ElevationData_57taxa.csv` contains minimum and maximum elevation for the 57-taxa dataset, as well as information on the specimens used to construct the phylogeny based on ND2 mitochondrial sequences, and the name with which each taxon is labeled on the tree in Figure 3.
