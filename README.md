# Introduction

This repository contains data on elevational distributions of birds in the genus Scytalopus we employed for analyses presented in:

    Cadena, C. D. & L. N. Céspedes. 2019. Origin of elevational replacements in a clade of nearly 
    flightless birds – most diversity in tropical mountains accumulates via secondary contact 
    following allopatric speciation. 2019. In press in: Rull, V. & Carnaval, A. (eds.), 
    Neotropical diversification. Springer, Berlin.
